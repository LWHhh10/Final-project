# Final-project
//Optical system for a dual-laser multi-material SLA 3D printing prototype.
//receive the G code and convert it into the information of the coordinate and position
//and send the voltage signal to the galva scanner via a DAC module which model is MCP4822
//Complete the linear and circular interpolations
//Implement the laser switching and dynamic focusing system
